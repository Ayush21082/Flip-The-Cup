## How to Play
 * When the game starts, keep your iPad at the same height as your head.
 * Find a comfortable angle where AR can detect 3D planes and wait for the alert ‚Äúpress okay to join‚Äù,until then please wait patiently.
 * Once the game starts 2 square boxes will appear and one of them will have a cylindrical shape on top of it, now you have to apply pressure by your fingers or thumb to make it reach to the next square.
 * As you proceed the score will increase and the number of square boxes will increase simultaneously.
 * Scoring of game is when you flip the cup and landed to the box you got 1 point then points get increasing, TRY NOT TO MISS and if you missed then you will lose the game.
